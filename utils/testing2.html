                Part 4: Test Phase
        </div>
	<div class="start-text">
		In the next section you will have to choose the cheapest ticket again, this time for your new trip to Mexico City.
		There will be again 60 consecutive sequences, 10 tickets each, with ticket prices as you just encountered.
		<br><br>
		Your total amount of points will be increased according to the same rules as before:
		<ul style="margin:8px 0px">
			<li><b>3 points</b> for picking the <b>cheapest ticket</b></li>
			<li><b>2 points</b> for picking the <b>second cheapest ticket</b></li>
			<li><b>1 point</b> for picking the <b>third, forth or fifth cheapest ticket</b></li>
			<li><b>0 points</b> otherwise</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		We remind you again that at the end your bonus will be proportional to your points, e.g. if you get all the points (360 points) you get $4.00, if you get half the points (180 points) you get $2.00.
