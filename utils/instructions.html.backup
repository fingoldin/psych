		<div class="cscroller">
                       	<p>
				Imagine that you are planning a trip abroad and now you are at the point where you want 
				to buy the airplane ticket. There are various providers that offer tickets for your trip 
				and they all very (more or less) in prices. Your goal is to find the cheapest ticket from 
				all the offers. 
				<br><br>
				There will be four parts in this experiment: 
				In the first part we want you to get familiar with the possible prices for tickets. 
				Therefore we will show you 50 ticket prices, as you would encounter them in you search. 
				In the second part of the experiment you have to choose a ticket out of ten tickets. 
				Since the tickets are presented one at the time you have to decide for every offer either 
				to accept or reject it â€“ with the difficulty that you cannot go back to a ticket once rejected. 
				In the third and the forth parts you will do the same as in the first and second part but with 
				different ticket prices. 
				<br><br>
				This study lasts at most 40 minutes and you will get 10 Dollars for participating. 
				Further, you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of 5 Dollars. 
				<br><br>
				You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study.
